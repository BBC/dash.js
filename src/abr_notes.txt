dash.js 1.5.1 notes.

Throughput rule

Uses type but the streamprocessor is already limited to a single type
No attempt to deal with cached response data.
Very few fragments used to decide how the throughput is.
Previous 2/3 requests are used regardless of when they were.
Historical Data is never removed.
Latency is ignored in throughput
Lots of things are recalculated every wall tick when they can only change when a new file is downloaded etc. pre-generate throughput etc.
